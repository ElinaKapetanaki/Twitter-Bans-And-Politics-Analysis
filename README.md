# Political Orientation and Social Media Suspensions: A Statistical Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project conducts an in-depth statistical analysis to examine whether political orientation influences social media suspensions. The study replicates the findings from **Moshen Moshel et al. (Nature)**, investigating whether **sanctions result from bias against political groups** or arise due to **differential misinformation sharing among political orientations**.

## 🔍 Key Research Question
- Do social media platforms disproportionately suspend accounts based on political orientation?

## 🛠️ Methodology
- **Data Collection**: Gathered datasets from publicly available suspension records, platform policy changes, and misinformation trackers.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Applied regression models and hypothesis testing to evaluate correlations.
- **Visualization**: Used data-driven charts to illustrate findings.

## 📊 Technologies Used
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Statsmodels)** – Statistical computing and data processing.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization.
- **Machine Learning (scikit-learn)** – Predictive modeling for suspension patterns.

## 🔬 Key Findings
- **Political orientation does not predict suspensions**; misinformation-sharing tendencies play a larger role, but a political party's followers can showcase higher misinformation sharing than others.
